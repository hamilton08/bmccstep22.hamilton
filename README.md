This introduction to python enhanced my appreciation for the field of programming as well as my interest in the technology I utilize on a daily basis.
Throughtout this journey, I managed to learn coding concepts and laws which I did not previously know, such as the proper use of punctuation marks, how to include math theory in my codes, and finally how to apply my knowledge to real-life circumstances. On the other hand, I also encountered moments in which I was unable to finish several of the tasks presented to me due to my lack of understanding, although eventually, after further analysis, I managed to complete the lesson.

Today I learned how to program the computer to make a decision given specific circumsatnces, as well as how to translate a word into another language given said inputed word. At the beginning it was hard to comprehend the logic behind some of the string, however, eventually (after trial and error) I managed to complete the tasks at hand.

Today I learned how to apply my coding skills to real life necesities such as planning a trip abroad. Throughout my learning experience I became confused with the amount of variables I had to take into account, however (after a lot of trial and error) I managed tocomplete the unit.
