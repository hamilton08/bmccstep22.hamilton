This introduction to python enhanced my appreciation for the field of programming as well as my interest in the technology I utilize on a daily basis.
Throughtout this journey, I managed to learn coding concepts and laws which I did not previously know, such as the proper use of punctuation marks, how to include math theory in my codes, and finally how to apply my knowledge to real-life circumstances. On the other hand, I also encountered moments in which I was unable to finish several of the tasks presented to me due to my lack of understanding, although eventually, after further analysis, I managed to complete the lesson.
